## Description
This is a C programming project that demonstrates the implementation of variadic functions. Variadic functions are functions that can accept a variable number of arguments. In this project, we have implemented a set of variadic functions following specific guidelines and constraints.

## Requirements
To compile and use this project, you will need the following:
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- GCC compiler with options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Editor (e.g., vi, vim, emacs) for writing code

## Usage
To use the variadic functions in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Compile the project using the provided `Makefile`:

4. Run the project:

## Examples
You can find example usage of the variadic functions in the provided `main.c` files within the project directory. These examples demonstrate how to use the functions to perform various tasks.
